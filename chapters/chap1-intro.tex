\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Sources}

The following notes are taken from the compilation of a few sources
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{MIT 18.100B Real Analysis, Spring 2025}, available at the MIT OCW youtube channel
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Purpose}

This notes are taken in a way that is easy to understan math. No obscure proof or incomplete idea will be included, avoiding partial understanding of a certain topic. It also covers the need of having an easy-to-follow apporach to \textit{Real Analysis}, making it possible to read this through to revisit known topics without the need of looking at other sources and rabbithole-ing into old books with russian lastnames on its cover. Since I will also be studying the course while taking this notes, the document as a whole will be written by hand without any AI slob nor blind copy/pasting, and since English is not my native language, typos may happen.
