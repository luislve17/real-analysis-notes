\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Sources}

The following notes are taken from the compilation of a few sources
\begin{itemize}
	\item Zorich, V. A. (2004). Mathematical analysis I (R. Cooke, Trans.). Springer.
	\item MIT 18.100B Real Analysis, Spring 2025, available at the MIT OCW youtube channel
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Purpose}

This notes are taken in a way that is easy to understan math for myself (the author). No obscure proof or incomplete idea will be included, avoiding partial understanding of a certain topic. It also covers the need of having an easy-to-follow approach to \textit{Real Analysis}, making it possible to read this through to revisit known topics without the need of rabbithole-ing at other sources. Since I will also be studying the course while taking this notes, the document as a whole will be written by hand without any AI slob nor blind copy/pasting, and since English is not my native language, typos may appear here and there.

\textit{When I say \textbf{we}, it means you (the reader) and I. When I say \textbf{I/myself}, responsability only lies on me (the author).}
